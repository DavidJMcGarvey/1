Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 2

##    List Pagination and Filtering    ##
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to my list pagination project!

*BASIC FEATURES*
The JavaScript file in this directory will enhance the HTML provided by paginating lists of students into crisp clean sets of 10 per page. Using the core principles of unobtrusive JavaScript, this app will be able to take HTML with any number of students, and display the appropriate number of students per page as well as links to all accompanying pages.

*EXTRA FEATURES*
These is also search functionality built into this app. Simple search a name in the provided search field to yield desired results. Enjoy!
